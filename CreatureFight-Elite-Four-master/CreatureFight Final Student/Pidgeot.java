 * TODO (153): Copy all code below public class Lapras and paste it below.
 *          You will make a few changes to the code to make it appropriate for
 *          Lapras. These are listed in order from top to bottom:
 *              - Change the constructor to say Pidgeot instead of Lapras
 *              - Pidgeot has 800 points of health
 *              - Pidgeot's type is Flying
 *              - Show text that Pidgeot has fainted when its health bar's value is 
 *                less than or equal to 0
 *                  - When Pidgeot faints, the second thing you should be checking is if getNewTwoCreature 
 *                    at 1 still has health
 *                      - You should be switching to Creature at index 1 if this is the case
 *              - Lapras's second attack...
 *                  - if used against a grass type...
 *                      - Should do two times 55 points of damage (DON'T DO THE MATH! Write the math expression)
 *                      - Should display that the attack is super effective at a location of
 *                        half the width of the world and half the height of the world plus 26
 *                  - otherwise, if used against a rock type...
 *                      - Should do half of 55 points of damage (DON'T DO THE MATH!)
 *                      - Should display that the attack is not very effective at a location of
 *                        half the width of the world and half the height of the world plus 26
 *                  - Delete the next otherwise if
 *                  - otherwise...
 *                      - Should do 55 points of damage
 *              - In switchCreature...
 *                      - In the else condition...
 *                          - Change player two to Lapras
